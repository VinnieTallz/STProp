# Security Guidelines

## Overview

This Smart Lock Manager prioritizes security at every level, from API key management to audit logging. This document outlines the security measures implemented and best practices for deployment.

## Security Measures

### 1. API Key Protection
- API keys are never stored in plain text in logs
- Keys are validated before use
- Secure storage in browser localStorage (development) or environment variables (production)
- Keys are sanitized in all log outputs

### 2. Audit Logging
- All lock operations are logged with timestamps
- Failed operations are tracked for security monitoring
- Logs include action type, target device, and success status
- No sensitive data is stored in logs

### 3. Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- API responses are validated before processing
- Type safety enforced throughout the application

### 4. Network Security
- HTTPS required for all API communications
- Request/response interceptors for monitoring
- Timeout protection against hanging requests
- Proper error handling to prevent information leakage

### 5. Rate Limiting
- Built-in rate limiting for API requests
- Protection against abuse and accidental overuse
- Configurable limits per environment

## Best Practices for Deployment

### Development Environment
1. Use sandbox environment exclusively
2. Never use production API keys in development
3. Regularly clear local storage of test data
4. Monitor console for security warnings

### Production Environment
1. Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
2. Implement proper user authentication
3. Set up monitoring and alerting for failed operations
4. Regularly rotate API keys
5. Use HTTPS exclusively
6. Implement proper session management

### API Key Management
1. **Never commit API keys to version control**
2. Use different keys for different environments
3. Rotate keys regularly (monthly recommended)
4. Monitor key usage in Seam Console
5. Revoke compromised keys immediately

### Access Control
1. Implement role-based access control for multi-user deployments
2. Log all administrative actions
3. Use principle of least privilege
4. Regular access reviews

## Incident Response

### If API Key is Compromised
1. Immediately revoke the key in Seam Console
2. Generate a new API key
3. Update all deployments with new key
4. Review audit logs for unauthorized activity
5. Document the incident

### If Unauthorized Access is Detected
1. Review audit logs for scope of access
2. Change all credentials
3. Check for any unauthorized lock operations
4. Notify affected users
5. Implement additional security measures

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual lock operation patterns
- API rate limit violations
- Device connectivity issues
- Schedule modification frequency

### Recommended Alerts
- Multiple failed API calls
- Locks going offline unexpectedly
- Unauthorized schedule modifications
- High error rates

## Data Protection

### Sensitive Data Handling
- Lock schedules and access patterns
- Device metadata and locations
- User activity logs
- API credentials

### Data Retention
- Audit logs: 90 days maximum
- Device data: As needed for operation
- User sessions: 24 hours maximum
- Error logs: 30 days maximum

### Data Encryption
- All data in transit encrypted via HTTPS
- Local storage data should be encrypted in production
- Database encryption at rest recommended

## Compliance Considerations

### Privacy
- Minimize data collection to operational needs only
- Provide clear data usage policies
- Implement data deletion capabilities
- Regular privacy impact assessments

### Security Standards
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Implement security headers
- Regular security audits
- Vulnerability scanning

## Emergency Procedures

### Lock Malfunction
1. Verify device connectivity
2. Check Seam service status
3. Use manual override if available
4. Contact device manufacturer support
5. Document incident for review

### System Compromise
1. Immediately disable API access
2. Revoke all credentials
3. Assess scope of compromise
4. Implement containment measures
5. Begin incident response procedures

## Regular Security Tasks

### Weekly
- Review audit logs for anomalies
- Check device connectivity status
- Verify backup procedures

### Monthly
- Rotate API keys
- Review user access permissions
- Update security documentation
- Test incident response procedures

### Quarterly
- Security audit and penetration testing
- Review and update security policies
- Training for users on security best practices
- Evaluate new security technologies
